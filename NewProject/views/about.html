<h3>About SPAID test<h3>
	
<p>SPAID is a term to describe the spectrum of clinical signs due to systemic and persistent inflammation in Chinese Shar-Pei.  All the signs in SPAID are autoinflammatory in nature and are related elevated levels of hyaluronan, a molecule which functions as a danger signal (a DAMP) that triggers the inflammatory response.  SPAID resembles human AID (autoinflammatory disease) that also presents with multiple inflammatory signs.  Many Shar-Pei with SPAID also receive relief from disease by the use of IL-1Î² inhibitors which suggests a cytokine-driven inflammation and a dysregulation of the innate immune response.  SPAID definitely is linked to increased levels of LMW-HA (low molecular weight hyaluronan) which appears to be a breed characteristic related to strong selective breeding for the heavily wrinkled phenotype.<p>
